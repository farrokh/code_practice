# Software Engineer Interview Preparation
Hi!
I'm a software engineer candidate and this is my repository of routine code problem practices. My goal is to record my submissions alongside result statistics and any best solution (as far as I'm able to find) for each problem.


Good luck with your interview preparation journey.
